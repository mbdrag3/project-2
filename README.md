This is a web application for storing and managing Pokemon collections.
Users will be able to search a substantial library of cards, if they log in then they will be able to
add them to their collection. Cards can be clicked on to view their details.âš¡ðŸ’¥  

## User Story
As an avid Pokemon collector, I would like a digital twin of my collection to manage my cards easily. I would like my collection to be stored in a password-protected account so
that my collection is safe and accessible to me wherever I need it.
